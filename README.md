My Statusboard
===========

###Why?

The purpose of this project was that there's not enough interactivity amongst all the visual displays around the CEB. Our goal was to understand what information students needed and what they don't. We had a choice between outside the classroom displays or in the main hallway/office display. The display that I chose to design for was outside the classroom using Panic's Statusboard App.

###How?

The first step in the process was really understanding why a student would want to look at a display in the first place. Once you had that question answered pretty well, you had to decide how to present that information. For me, I decided that what students want most is to see the classroom schedule, time, instructor's office hours, and a feed of current events. The tools used were a text editor to create basic HTML stylings as Panic's Statusboard cannot handle rich HTML content. Another tool I realized I needed to use was Excel. The statusboard has a feature to load .csv files as tables to display infromation.
